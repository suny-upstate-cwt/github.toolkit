# SUNY Upstate CWT GitHub Toolkit Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the SUNY Upstate CWT GitHub Toolkit. This documentation provides comprehensive information about our shared GitHub Actions workflows and how to use them effectively in your projects.

## What is the GitHub Toolkit?

The GitHub Toolkit is a centralized collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows maintained by the SUNY Upstate CWT team. These workflows are designed to standardize development processes across our repositories and provide consistent automation for common tasks.

## Quick Start

2. Follow the setup instructions for your chosen workflow
3. Add the workflow to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
4. Configure any required parameters

## Featured Workflows

While we're actively developing our workflow collection, here are some key categories we're focusing on:
