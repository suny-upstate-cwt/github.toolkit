# SUNY Upstate CWT GitHub Toolkit

A centralized repository of reusable GitHub Actions workflows and documentation for standardizing development processes across SUNY Upstate CWT repositories.

## Overview

This toolkit provides a collection of shared GitHub Actions workflows that can be reused across different repositories within the SUNY Upstate CWT organization. By centralizing these workflows, we aim to:

- Standardize development processes across teams and projects
- Reduce duplicate workflow maintenance
- Provide consistent documentation and best practices
- Simplify the setup of new repositories

## Available Workflows

*Note: Specific workflows will be added here as they are implemented. Workflows may include both adapted versions of existing open-source solutions and custom implementations specific to SUNY Upstate CWT needs.*

### Planned Categories:

- Release Management
- Code Quality Checks
- Deployment Pipelines
- Security Scanning
- Documentation Generation
- Testing Automation
